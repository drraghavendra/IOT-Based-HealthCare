# IOT-Based-HealthCare

Objective of project Within aged care we are seeing an expansion of  the deployment of smart devices wearables, room
based monitoring systems, etc. to help monitor  patients. Individually these devices are good, but
we do not yet have good ways of making individual or combined data streams available to healthcare
staff in order to improve the quality of care that  patients receive. We would like to use this data to
improve the standard of care, which dramatically increase the rollout of smart devices to aged care
as people would see the clear benefits of doing so. The technology is available and affordable, we just
need the right incentives to see its uptake increase.
